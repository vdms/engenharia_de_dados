    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This MVP successfully delivered a **complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline** in Databricks (Bronze → Silver → Gold) using public, aggregated PIX data from the Central Bank of Brazil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project covered the full lifecycle of a data pipeline, including raw data ingestion, standardization and scope enforcement in the Silver layer, analytical modeling through a star schema in the Gold layer, and reproducible data quality validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Questions Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the **9 proposed business questions**, **7 were successfully addressed** using the available dataset for the 2023–2024 period.\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions focused on:\n",
    "- temporal evolution of PIX usage,\n",
    "- differences between payer and receiver profiles,\n",
    "- behavioral patterns by age group,\n",
    "- regional segmentation,\n",
    "- transaction nature and purpose,\n",
    "- and regional concentration of PIX activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "All answers were supported by **query-based analytical evidence** generated from the Gold layer and documented in a dedicated analysis notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Two business questions could not be answered within the scope of this MVP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Income level of PIX users**  \n",
    "  The dataset does not include income information or reliable proxies. Addressing this question would require enrichment with external socioeconomic data sources (e.g., IBGE datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Essential vs non-essential expenses**  \n",
    "  Although transaction nature and purpose are available, the dataset does not provide an official or standardized classification distinguishing essential from non-essential expenses. Answering this question would require an explicit semantic classification layer, documented as an analytical assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations reflect **constraints of the source data**, not shortcomings of the pipeline design or implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "A key technical takeaway from this MVP was the importance of **clear contracts between pipeline layers**, particularly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- enforcing analytical scope and data types in the Silver layer,\n",
    "- modeling facts and dimensions with explicit grain in the Gold layer,\n",
    "- and validating assumptions through deterministic data quality checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach reduced ambiguity, simplified analysis, and increased confidence in the analytical outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Future iterations of this project could explore:\n",
    "- automated data quality monitoring,\n",
    "- richer metadata and lineage documentation,\n",
    "- enrichment with complementary public datasets to expand analytical scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "These extensions could be introduced incrementally without changing the core pipeline structure established in this MVP.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This MVP prioritizes **correctness, transparency, and reproducibility** over complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "All insights are derived from **aggregated monthly data**, not transaction-level records, and should be interpreted accordingly. The project demonstrates how a well-structured data engineering pipeline can support analytical exploration while making its limitations explicit.\n"
